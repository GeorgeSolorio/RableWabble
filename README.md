# RableWabble

## About
A case study based on [RayWendelich's iOS Design Patterns](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/design-patterns-by-tutorials/v3.0) tutorial. 
This project includes common and essential design patterns found in many iOS apps.The app consists of common design patterns found in many
iOS apps, allowing the user to create quizes, test and grade their results, choose between random or sequential order of questions, save and display
user's quiz results.

## Learning Objectives
To learn common design patterns found in many iOS apps. Patterns such as
* Model-View-Controller
* Delegation
* Strategy
* Singleton
* Memento
* Observer
* Builder

## Usage
You can launch this project in Xcode and simulate the app on your preffered device simulator. You can also try to install it on your physical iOS device.
This app is perfect for practicing japanese! You will be greeted with a set of questions to questions to choose from, you get the choice of setting your questions randomly or sequentially. You can even create your own set of questions!!
